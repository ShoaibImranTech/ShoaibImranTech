## About Me

I build web applications and AI-powered tools that solve real problems. My background spans full-stack development, machine learning engineering, and cloud infrastructure—I'm most interested in projects where these disciplines intersect.

Currently focused on scalable systems architecture, real-time data processing, and applying ML/NLP to production environments. I believe good software is measured by its impact, maintainability, and the problems it solves.

**Frontend**  
React, Next.js, TypeScript, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS

**Backend**  
Node.js, Python, Django, FastAPI, Express.js, GraphQL

**AI/ML**
